            <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Why I Built This</h2>
            <p class="lead-para">
                I wanted to create a <strong>battery-powered handheld device</strong> that could do it all—high-performance graphics, mesh networking, and multiple applications—while running on severe hardware constraints. The challenge was integrating my <strong>FPR mesh communication project</strong> with a custom UI framework on resource-limited hardware.
            </p>
            <p class="lead-para">
                Raminox is a testbed for pushing ESP32 to its limits, demonstrating that with careful optimization, you can build <strong>professional-grade portable devices</strong> with impressive capabilities on affordable hardware.
            </p>
            <p class="lead-para">
                <strong>This project became an exercise in controlled chaos.</strong> Imagine trying to coordinate a graphics engine demanding consistent frame timing, a mesh network that needs to respond within milliseconds, an audio system that can't tolerate buffer underruns, and a responsive UI—all competing for CPU time and memory on a battery-powered device that needs to run for hours, not minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="lead-para">
                Early prototypes were disasters. The UI would lag when mesh packets arrived. Graphics would stutter during network activity. Audio would glitch under heavy load. I realized I needed to think like an orchestra conductor, not just a programmer. I spent weeks tuning FreeRTOS priorities, implementing smart buffering strategies, and designing subsystems that could gracefully degrade when resources were tight. The graphics engine got double-buffering and dirty rectangle tracking to minimize redraws. The FPR networking stack got optimized for burst processing. Power management became predictive, ramping down components before they were needed.
            </p>
            <p class="lead-para">
                The breakthrough was treating <strong>failure as a feature, not a bug</strong>. What happens when the mesh network drops? The device keeps working. Low battery? Non-essential features shut down gracefully. Memory pressure? Apps get notified before crashes happen. It's not just about making features work—it's about making them work together, even when things go wrong.

            <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Technical Challenges Solved</h2>
            <p class="lead-para">
                The complexity comes from integrating <strong>multiple demanding subsystems</strong> on battery-powered hardware:
            </p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>System Integration:</strong> Coordinated custom graphics engine, FPR mesh networking, audio system, and UI framework—each with competing resource demands</li>
                <li><strong>Power Constraints:</strong> Achieved ~12mA idle consumption through aggressive power management while maintaining instant wake-up and responsive UI</li>
                <li><strong>Graphics Performance:</strong> Hit 60 FPS on a 128&times;64 OLED through double-buffering, custom blitting algorithms, and pixel-perfect memory management</li>
                <li><strong>Multitasking:</strong> Balanced FreeRTOS task priorities to handle real-time networking, smooth graphics, and user input without lag</li>
                <li><strong>Graceful Degradation:</strong> Implemented failure handling across all subsystems—mesh disconnects, low battery, memory pressure—ensuring device remains usable</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Density:</strong> Packed networking, graphics, audio, storage, and debugging into limited flash/RAM through careful architecture and code optimization</li>
