## Temporary Placeholders

Until you add your own images, you can:
1. Use placeholder images from services like:
   - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) - Free high-quality photos
   - [Pexels](https://pexels.com) - Free stock photos
   - Search for: "ESP32", "IoT device", "electronics", "circuit board"

2. Create simple placeholder images with text indicating the project

3. Use screenshots from your GitHub repositories

## Image Optimization Tips

Before uploading images:
1. **Resize** to recommended dimensions
2. **Compress** using tools like:
   - [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com)
   - [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app)
   - ImageOptim (for Mac)
3. **Convert** large PNGs to JPG when transparency isn't needed
4. Target **under 300KB** per image for optimal load times

## Adding Images

1. Save your images in this directory with the exact filenames specified
2. The website will automatically display them
3. No code changes needed if you use the correct filenames
4. Refresh your browser to see the updates
